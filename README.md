# Project Overview
You have just returned home from a trip overseas and are approaching the US Immigration line when you suddenly realize that you lost your passport and wallet! As you think of the hassle of trying to get through immigration without it, you remember that the airport has just been updated with a state-of-the-art system that eliminates the need to carry any personal identifying information on you. All you have to do is provide a SS# and you are clear! Sure there are other headaches that await you but at least this will be easy. 

This magic is accomplished by querying for data from the Social Security Department, the DMV, and the Department of State and displaying only the information that the Immigration agent needs to verify the identification.
